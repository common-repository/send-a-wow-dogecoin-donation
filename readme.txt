== Description ==

For a full description and a configuration reference visit (http://www.send-a-wow.org)
 
Send a Wow! makes it easy for your visitors to transfer some money in the form of crypto currency as a thank you or as a Wow!-reaction for well written blog articles. It is preconfigured for the famoust digital currency dogecoin but can be also setuped for e.g bitcoin. It do not use any third services! It uses the decentralized way crypto currency is made for: A transfer from wallet to wallet. If you install the Send a Wow!-Plugin there will be a button under each of your blog article.


If you prefer the button on the left side, add this to your css file:

.saw-container {

    float: none !important;

}

== Installation ==

Upload the Send a Wow! plugin to your blog, Activate it, then go to the new menu "Send a Wow!" and configure your (Doge)coin address. If you use another coin you has to change the "Coin Network" settings to eg. bitcoin instead of dogecoin. 

For a blogger who is new to this: You will need a wallet software to get the coins - there you can create also your address.
